INSTEAD OF COPYING THE FILE SYSTEM SNAPSHOT IN THE CONTAINER, WE PUT THE REFERENCE IN THE CONTAINER OF LOCAL FILE SYSTEM
WHENEVER CHANGES WILL HAPPEN IN THE LOCAL FILE SYSTEM, THAT CHANGES WILL BE DETECTED INSIDE THE CONTAINER

docker run -v $(pwd):/app <image name || id>

MAP WHAT IS INSIDE THE $(pwd) (EVERYTHING) TO THE /app FOLDER IN THE CONTAINER

THIS WILL ALSO MAP THE NODE_MODULES, TO PREVENT THE MAPPING OF NODE_MODULES, WE HAVE TO USE ANOTHER VOLUME
docker run -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app <image name || id>

NOTE THERE IS NOT ":" HERE, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT MAPPING, WE ARE JUST PRESERVING
