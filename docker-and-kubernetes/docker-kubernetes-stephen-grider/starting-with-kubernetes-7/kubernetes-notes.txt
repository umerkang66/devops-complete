PODS: 
    One or more containers should be created in pod, containers that are tightly coupled. Don't use in production.

DEPLOYMENT: 
    Maintain a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config, and that the right number exist. It doesn't create the pods, but it tells master to create the pods, then it manages them.

SERVICES: 
    There are 4 types of services
    1) ClusterIP
    2) NodePort
    3) LoadBalancer
    4) Ingress

2) NODE_PORT: 
    Expose a pod to the outside world (only good for dev purposes)

MASTER: 
    We interact with k8s with master, Master decides where to create the container (in which node). To deploy something, we update the desired state of the master with a config file. The master works constantly to meet your desired state
