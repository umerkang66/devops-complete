USE TO CREATE DOCKER IMAGES FROM Dockerfile
docker build .
"." should be where the Dockerfile is located


FOR EVERY INSTRUCTION WE ADDED IN THE Dockerfile (EXCEPT THE FIRST ONE), AN INTERMEDIATE CONTAINER IS CREATED TEMPORARILY, THAT RUNS THAT COMMAND (INSTRUCTION), UPDATE THE FILE SYSTEM SNAPSHOT, SAVE THE FILE SYSTEM IN THE NEW IMAGE
THE NEXT INSTRUCTION WILL CREATE CONTAINER FROM PREVIOUSLY CREATED IMAGE, IT WILL ALSO DO SOME WORK IN THE CONTAINER, SAVE THE FILE SYSTEM SNAPSHOT IN THE NEW IMAGE


TAGGING (NAMING) THE IMAGE
docker build -t <docker id>/<project name>:latest .

THAT LAST latest IS ACTUALLY A TAG, OTHER IS ACTUALLY NAME OF THE PROJECT

MANUALLY CREATING IMAGES FROM CONTAINERS
CHANGE THE CONTAINER AFTER ENTERING IN THE SHELL STATE OF CONTAINER THEN CREATE THE ANOTHER IMAGE USING THIS BELOW COMMAND

docker commit -c 'CMD ["redis-server"]' 3529a7db837b
THIS WILL CREATE NEW IMAGE WITH DEFAULT COMMAND "redis-server"
