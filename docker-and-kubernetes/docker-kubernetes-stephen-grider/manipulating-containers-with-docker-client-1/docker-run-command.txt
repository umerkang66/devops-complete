RUN ANY IMAGE
docker run <image name>

When we run the image, there is always default command, that runs after the container is created, we can override that default command

docker run <image name> <overriding command>

SEE THE RUNNING CONTAINERS
docker ps
SEE THE STOPPED CONTAINERS
docker ps --all

Docker run is actually combination of two commands:
1) docker create 
2) docker start [-a]

Creating the container and starting the container are two different things, "-a" means watch the output from the container and print out in the terminal

DELETE EVERYTHING DOCKER RELATED
docker system prune -a

RETRIEVE THE LOGS FROM CONTAINER
docker logs <container id>

STOP THE RUNNING CONTAINER
docker stop <container id> (wait for some time for cleanup, sends SIGTERM SIGNAL) (if the time is more than 10 seconds, docker kill command will be issued)
docker kill <container id> (abruptly stops the container, sends SIGKILL SIGNAL)

START ANOTHER PROGRAM INSIDE THE RUNNING CONTAINER
docker exec -it <running container id> [command]
e.g. docker exec -it <container id> <command>
e.g. docker exec -it 22e5dff10dd2 redis-cli

-it: Start the program in interactive mode (we can enter text), it consist of the two commands, -i, -t, "-i" means to attach to STDIN of the command, "-t" just makes our text look pretty

OPEN UP SHELL IN THE CONTEXT OF TERMINAL
docker exec -it <container id> sh

WE CAN ALSO OPEN UP THE SHELL WHEN STARTING THE CONTAINER (PREVIOUSLY WE WERE DOING AFTER STARTING THE CONTAINER: BY USING CONTAINER ID)
docker run -it <image name> <command>
